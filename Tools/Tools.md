Babel: JS complier that transforms modern JS code to older dialects (i.e. ES6 to ES5) for wider brawser support.

Webpack: 
- module bundler that takes all JS files and bundle them into a single file.
- enables ES modules so we can import/export variables and don't need to worry about the order of the script tags in the html.
- it starts at an entry point then traverses all imports to get all used code and merges them into one bundle. 
- it minifies code (for production builds) to a smaller bundle size.
